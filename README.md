# Neek
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/whitfin/neek.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/whitfin/neek)

A simple way to filter duplicate lines from a list, Ã  la uniq. Takes an input and filters to an output removing duplicates.

### Compatibility ###

The current version of `Neek` is designed using several features of `ES6`; namely the `Set` interface. If this is not available, it will fall back to a library interface which is not as fast (but it's still pretty good). As such, best performance occurs when on `Node >= v4.0.0` and all numbers in this README will refer to this version.

### Setup ###

Depending on your use case, there are two different ways you can install Neek. The first is as a global module, mostly for use when scripting in a shell.

```
$ npm install -g neek
```

You can also install it as a local module in case you wish to use it inside another tool:

```
$ npm install neek
```

### Usage ###

As mentioned, there are two ways to use Neek. The first use, and probably the most common, is simply invoking via a shell, or using inside a shell to remove duplicate lines:

```
$ neek --input dup_file.txt -o output.txt

$ cat dup_file.txt | neek -o output.txt
```

The shell version takes these parameters:

```
-i, --input         an input file to process
-o, --output        a file to output to
-q, --quiet         only output the processed data
```

The other use is from within a Node module which requires some processing to output text without duplicates, although I expect this will be less common. Below is an example inside Node:

Please note that `input`/`output` accept either a String path or a Stream.

```
var neek = require('neek');

var readable = './test/resources/lines_with_dups.txt';
var writable = './test/resources/output_without_dups.txt';

neek.unique(readable, writable, function(result){
  console.log(result);
});
```

### unique(input, output[, callback])

The unique method is the only method currently available on the `neek` module. You pass in your two Streams and an optional callback.

The `output` parameter can take the value 'string', which will pass the output to the callback in `result.output`, rather than piping it to a stream. The callback to `unique` is optional, but be careful when omitting it in case you're depending on the Stream being written.

If you pass a String type to either `input` or `output` (when output `!== 'string'`) it will be wrapped up in a read/write stream, with the assumption that it is a file path.

This object contains three fields; output, size and count. These fields translate to the following:

```
output  - output of the process, if you chose a string output - otherwise null
total   - the number of lines processed
unique  - the final amount of lines (without duplicate data)
```

### Comparison ###

On a test set of a 527MB file containing 1,071,367 total lines with 443,917 unique lines, below is a comparison of the performance of Unix tools `uniq` and `sort`, and then `neek`. `uniq` is assuming that your data is sorted.

**Uniq**

```
$ time uniq test-set.txt > deduplicated.txt

real	0m38.922s
user	0m37.647s
sys	    0m1.105s
```

In the unfortunately case that your data isn't sorted, you would have to use `sort`, however Neek behaves the same regardless of order.

**Sort**

```
$ time sort -u test-set.txt > deduplicated.txt

real	2m16.459s
user	2m13.757s
sys	    0m2.186s
```

Now let's look at Neek!

**Neek**

```
$ time bin/neek --input test-set.txt -o deduplicated.txt

real	0m9.581s
user	0m8.615s
sys	    0m1.588s
```

As you can see, Neek is ~4.1x (around 400%) faster to run than `uniq` and ~14.2x (around 1400%) faster to run than `sort`, meaning it's invaluable for larger files. Aside from being far faster Neek uses efficient pipes, which is far better for memory usage. Tools like `sort` will buffer the entire file into memory, making it a bad choice for large files.

### Redirection ###

On versions **prior** to Node v4.x one important thing to note is that a shell redirection is slightly faster than using the `--output` flag. In the processing of the above file, the `--output` flag took an extra 9 seconds due to the overheads inside Node.

Where possible, I would recommend simply using a shell redirection. If you do use a redirection, make sure to pass `-q`. Here is a comparison:

```
$ time bin/neek --input test-set.txt -q > deduplicated.txt

real	0m19.928s
user	0m16.596s
sys	    0m3.653s

$ time bin/neek --input test-set.txt --output deduplicated.txt

real	0m30.536s
user	0m22.242s
sys	    0m10.883s
```

In post Node v4.x, this is **not** an issue (in fact the situation is almost reversed, shell redirection is far slower).
